# Contributing to Waylon projects

Contributions to Waylon projects include code, documentation, answering user questions,
running the project's infrastructure, and advocating for all types of users.

The Waylon group welcomes all contributions from anyone willing to work in
good faith with other contributors and the community. No contribution is too
small and all contributions are valued.


## [Code of Conduct](./doc/guides/contributing/coc.md)

Every Waylon project has a
[Code of Conduct](https://gitlab.com/waylon-private/waylon-access-control-client-nodejs/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
that *all* contributors are expected to follow. This code describes the
*minimum* behavior expectations for all contributors.

See [details on our policy on Code of Conduct](https://gitlab.com/waylon-private/waylon-access-control-client-nodejs/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Issues

Issues in our project are the primary means by which bug reports and
general discussions are made.

For any issue, there are fundamentally three ways an individual can
contribute:

1. By opening the issue for discussion: For instance, if you believe that you
   have uncovered a bug in the project, creating a new issue in the project
   issue tracker is the way to report it.
2. By helping to triage the issue: This can be done either by providing
   supporting details (a test case that demonstrates a bug), or providing
   suggestions on how to address the issue.
3. By helping to resolve the issue: Typically this is done either in the form
   of demonstrating that the issue reported is not a problem after all, or more
   often, by opening a Pull Request that changes some bit of something in
   project in a concrete and reviewable manner.

When opening a new issue in the issue tracker, users will be
presented with a basic template that should be filled in.

```markdown
<!--

## [Pull Requests](./doc/guides/contributing/pull-requests.md)

Pull Requests are the way concrete changes are made to the code, documentation,
dependencies, and tools contained in the project repository.
